                <!--<h3>OM Symbol In Yoga</h3>-->
                <p>The om or aum symbol is one of the most sacred and powerful Hindu mantras.<br>It symbolizes the consciousness of the universe or the sound of the universe.

                    This symbol represents the “om” sound that people often repeatedly make during meditation to gain focus.
                    
                    Likewise, this word is often said before or after yoga asana.</p>

               <!-- <h3>Why Are There So Many Yoga Poses?</h3>-->
                <p>The answer is: a lot! According to David Gordon White, author of the book “Yoga in Practice,” there are over 84,000 yoga poses. That’s a lot of yoga poses!<br>As our understanding of the human body grows, we are able to come up with new ways to stretch and exercise it.

                    Additionally, as more people practice yoga, they may discover new variations of existing poses that work better for them.
                    
                    Finally, some people simply enjoy coming up with new yoga poses – it’s a fun and creative way to stay fit!
                    
                    Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that the number of yoga poses will continue to grow in the future.</p>
