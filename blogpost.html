        <p class="font1">#1 Yoga Means Union</p>
        <p class="font1">Sadhguru: In the western part of the world, if you utter the word “Yoga,” people think of
            impossible physical postures. This is a very distorted idea of what Yoga is. Yoga is not about bending and
            twisting your body or holding your breath. It is a mechanism and a technology to get you to that state of
            experience where you see reality just the way it is.

            The word “Yoga” literally means “union.”

            As you sit here, your idea and your sense and experience of who you are is very strong. You are here as an
            individual. But what the trees are exhaling right now, you are inhaling; what you are exhaling, the trees
            are inhaling. In other words, one half of your lung is hanging out there. This is not just in terms of
            breath. Today, modern physics is proving to you that as you sit here, every subatomic particle in your body
            is in constant transaction with everything else in the existence. If this transaction stops, you will cease
            to exist. So, Yoga means to know the union of existence by experience.<br>

            Modern science is proving to you that the whole existence is just one energy. The religions of the world
            have been saying for a long time that God is everywhere. Whether you say, “God is everywhere,” or you say,
            “Everything is one energy,” we are talking about the same reality. It is just that a scientist has never
            experienced this – he has arrived at it through mathematical deductions; a religious person has not
            experienced it – he believes it because it is written somewhere or has been said by someone.<br>

            If you are such a hard nut that you are not willing to settle for deductions or belief systems, then you
            become a Yogi. When you know the oneness of existence like you experience the five fingers of your hand,
            then we say you are in Yoga.</p><br>
        <p class="font1">#2 Yoga Signifies a Complete Path by Itself<br>
            What Yoga means is to move towards an experiential reality where one knows the ultimate nature of the
            existence, the way it is made. Essentially, in the tradition, once we attach the word “Yoga” to anything, it
            indicates that it is a complete path by itself. We say “Hatha Yoga,” but we will not say “Asana Yoga.”<br>

            If it was just a simple practice or an exercise, you could approach it one way. If it was an art form or
            just entertainment, it could be approached another way. Today, people say “Recreational Yoga,” “Health
            Yoga,” or people refer to it as an art form. They think they are doing a service to Yoga by saying it is an
            art form. No. The moment you attach the word “Yoga,” it indicates it is a complete path by itself.
        </p><br>
        <p class="font1">#3 Yoga is a Technology for Transformation
            Everything that human beings can do is essentially an expression of who they are. Someone sings a song,
            someone dances, someone writes a book, someone paints a picture. You may be conscious of it or not, but
            everything that you say and do is essentially an expression of who you. <br>

            Yoga is diametrically opposite to this because it is not an expression of who you are; it is about
            determining who you are; it is about changing the very fundamentals of one’s existence. Today there is
            substantial medical and scientific evidence to show that the very fundamentals of the activity of your
            brain, your chemistry, and even your genetic content can be changed by practicing different systems of Yoga.
            This needs no confirmation because we have always witnessed this, but today there is scientific data to
            prove this.<br>

            If you find full expression through any particular activity, it may also leave you somewhat transformed. If
            you cook, sing, or dance with all your heart, some transformation may happen. That is only a certain impact
            that is happening because of absolute involvement in a particular activity, but essentially that activity by
            its nature is an expression of who you are, not determining the nature of who you are. But Yoga is not an
            expression, it is a technology through which you can change the shape of who you are – both literally and
            otherwise.</p>

                <!--<h3>OM Symbol In Yoga</h3>-->
                <p>The om or aum symbol is one of the most sacred and powerful Hindu mantras.<br>It symbolizes the
                    consciousness of the universe or the sound of the universe.

                    This symbol represents the “om” sound that people often repeatedly make during meditation to
                    gain focus.

                    Likewise, this word is often said before or after yoga asana.</p>

                    <h3>Why Are There So Many Yoga Poses?</h3>
                </a>
                <!-- <h3>Why Are There So Many Yoga Poses?</h3>-->
                <p>The answer is: a lot! According to David Gordon White, author of the book “Yoga in Practice,”
                    there are over 84,000 yoga poses. That’s a lot of yoga poses!<br>As our understanding of the
                    human body grows, we are able to come up with new ways to stretch and exercise it.

                    Additionally, as more people practice yoga, they may discover new variations of existing poses
                    that work better for them.

                    Finally, some people simply enjoy coming up with new yoga poses – it’s a fun and creative way to
                    stay fit!

                    Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that the number of yoga poses will continue to grow in
                    the future.</p>
